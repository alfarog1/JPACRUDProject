*Project Requirement
You'll push your project to a Github repo named JPACRUDProject. Be sure to include a README.md detailing the technologies used as well as the purpose of the application.

Your project utilizes a MySQL database to manipulate data. For this project you are only required to have a single table and entity.

The MySQL table is mapped to a valid JPA Entity and tested to ensure the mappings are working correctly.

A Spring project allows for a user to perform basic CRUD operations on your entity via a web interface.

Your project and database are deployed to your AWS instance.
